Independent Research Project - Code
============================

Joey can be cloned from here https://github.com/devitocodes/joey/. Devito and other dependencies such as PyTorch and Sympy will be installed automatically. It can either be installed using docker or conda, hence it can run on any operating system.

The additions to the joey code are posted separately on this current ACSE repository for assessment. However, the non-university GitHub account was used for the duration of the project, hence the code and its version control history can be found there: https://github.com/cha-tzi/devito/tree/ml. All scripts include the link to their location in the personal GitHub account.
